This is a system daemon implementing the TPM2 access broker (TAB) & Resource
Manager (RM) spec from the TCG. The daemon (tpm2-abrmd) is implemented using
Glib and the GObject system. In this documentation and in the code we use
`tpm2-abrmd` and `tabrmd` interchangeably.

#Daemon
Communication between the daemon and clients using the TPM is done with a
combination of DBus and Unix pipes. DBus is used for discovery, session
management and the 'cancel', 'setLocality', and 'getPollHandles' API calls
(mostly these aren't yet implemented). Pipes are used to send and receive
TPM commands and responses (respectively) between client and server.

The daemon owns the com.intel.tss2.Tabrmd name on dbus. It can be configured
to connect to either the system or the session bus. Configuring name
selection would be a handy feature but that's future work.

Check out the man page TPM2-ABRMD(8) for the currently supported options.
