The specifications that define the TPM2 Software Stack (TSS2) described the
TPM Access Broker (TAB) as a mechanism to synchronize multi-process access to
the TPM. The TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI) is the API client
applications use to send commands to the TAB.

This repository contains an implementation of the TAB as a Linux daemon. We
call it 'tabd' per the Unix daemon convention. A TCTI for communicating with
the tabd is also provided. Clients should use this TCTI along with a SAPI
implementation when writing TPM2 Linux applications.
