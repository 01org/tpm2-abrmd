This is a system daemon implementing the TPM2 access broker (TAB) & Resource
Manager (RM) spec from the TCG. The daemon is implemented using Glib and the
GObject system.

Communication between the daemon and clients using the TPM is done with a
combination of DBus and Unix pipes. DBus is used for discovery, session
management and the 'cancel', 'setLocality', and 'getPollHandles' API calls
(mostly these aren't yet implemented). Pipes are used to send and receive
TPM commands and responses (respectively) between client and server.

The client library for interacting with this daemon (libtcti-abrmd) is also
provided in this repository. It is intended for use with the SAPI library
(libsapi) like any other TCTI.
