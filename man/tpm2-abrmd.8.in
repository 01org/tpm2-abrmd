.SH NAME
tpm2-abrmd \- TPM2 access broker and resource management daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tpm2-abrmd 
.RB [\-m][\-e][\-i][\-o][\-l\ logger-name][\-r][\-s][\-g\ /dev/urandom][\-t\ tcti-filename]
[\-c\ tcti-conf]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tpm2-abrmd
is a daemon that implements the TPM access broker and resource manager as
described by the Trusted Computing Group (TGC) in the
.B \*(lqTSS System Level API and TPM Command Transmission Interface
.B Specification\*(rq.
This daemon uses the DBus system bus and some pipes to communicate with
clients.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-t,\ \-\-tcti\fR
Select the TCTI used by tabd for communication with the next component down
the TSS stack. In most configurations this will be the TPM accessed through
the 'device TCTI' but it could be a simulator or proxy. Only TCTIs that
implement the common TCTI initialization mechanism are supported. Pass the
Name of the TCTI library to load using this option. Values for this
parameter will depend on the TCTI. Libraries are found using the same
algorithm as dlopen (3).
.TP
\fB\-c,\ \-\-tcti-conf\fR
Specify the configureation string passed to the TCTI during the 'dynamic'
loading and initialization. The format for this string is TCTI specific.
.TP
\fB\-o,\ \-\-allow-root\fR
Allow daemon to run as root. If this option is not provided the daemon will
refused to run as the root user. Use of this option is \fBnot\fR recommended.
.TP
\fB\-m,\ \-\-max-connections\fR
Set an upper bound on the number of concurrent client connections allowed.
Once this number of client connections is reached new connections will be
rejected with an error.
.TP
\fB\-f,\ \-\-flush-all\fR
Flush all objects and sessions when daemon is started.
.TP
\fB\-l,\ \-\-logger\fR
Direct logging output to named logging target. Supported targets are
\fBstdout\fR and \fBsyslog\fR. If the logger option is not specified the
default is \fBstdout\fR.
.TP
\fB\-e,\ \-\-max-sessions\fR
Set and upper bound on the number of sessions that each client connection
is allowed to create (loaded or active) at any one time.
.TP
\fB\-r,\ \-\-max-transient-objects\fR
Set an upper bound on the number of transient objects that each client
connection allowed to load. Once this number of objects is reached attempts
to load new transient objects will produce an error.
.TP
\fB\-n,\ \-\-dbus-name\fR
Claim the given name on dbus. This option overrides the default of
com.intel.tss2.Tabrmd.
.TP
\fB\-g,\ \-\-prng-seed-file\fR
Read seed for pseudo-random number generator from the provided file.
.TP
\fB\-s,\ \-\-session\fR
Connect daemon to the session dbus. This option overrides the default
behavior.
.TP
\fB\-v,\ \-\-version\fR
Disply version string.
