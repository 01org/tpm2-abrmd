.SH NAME
tabd \- TPM2 access broker daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tabd 
.RB [\-c][\-o][\-l\ logger-name][\-r][\-s][\-t\ tcti-name][tcti-specific-options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tabd
is a daemon that implements the TPM access broker as described by the Trusted
Computing Group (TGC) in the
.B \*(lqTSS System Level API and TPM Command Transmission Interface
.B Specification\*(rq.
This daemon used DBus and some pipes to communicate with clients. Eventually,
it will implement the functionality of both both a TPM access broker (TAB)
and a resource manager (RM).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c,\ \-\-max-connections\fR
Set an upper bound on the number of concurrent client connections allowed.
Once this number of client connections is reached new connections will be
rejected with an error.
.TP
\fB\-o,\ \-\-fail-on-loaded-trans\fR
Cause the daemon to fail on startup when the TPM is found to already have
transient objects loaded. This is intended as a safe-guard to keep the
daemon from stomping on the TPM state setup by another process.
.TP
\fB\-l,\ \-\-logger\fR
Direct logging output to named logging target. Supported targets are
\fBstdout\fR and \fBsyslog\fR. If the logger option is not specified the
default is \fBstdout\fR.
.TP
\fB\-r,\ \-\-max-transient-objects\fR
Set an upper bound on the number of transient objects that each client
connection allowed to load. Once this number of objects is reached attempts
to load new transient objects will produce an error.
.TP
\fB\-s,\ \-\-system\fR
Connect daemon to the system dbus. If this option is omitted the session bus
is used instead.
.TP
\fB\-t,\ \-\-tcti\fR
Select the TCTI used by tabd for communication with the next component down
the TSS stack. In most configurations this will be the TPM but it could be
a simulator or proxy. Supported TCTIs are \fB\*(lqecho\*(rq\fR
.if (\n[HAVE_DEVICE_TCTI]) or \fB\*(lqdevice\*(rq\fR
.if (\n[HAVE_SOCKET_TCTI]) or \fB\*(lqsocket\*(rq\fR
\[char46]
.\" Conditional inclusion of the device TCTI options
.if (\n[HAVE_DEVICE_TCTI]) \{ .TP
\fB\-d,\ \-\-tcti-device\fR
Specify the TPM device file for use by the device TCTI. The default is
/dev/tpm0.
\}
.\" Conditional inclusion of the socket TCTI options
.if (\n[HAVE_SOCKET_TCTI]) \{ .TP
\fB\-a,\ \-\-tcti-socket-address\fR
Specify the domain name or IP address used by the socket TCTI. The default
is 127.0.0.1.
.TP
\fB\-p,\ \-\-tcti-socket-port\fR
Specify the port number used by the socket TCTI. The default is 2222.
